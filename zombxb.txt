It was a normal day at Farmer Owen's farm. Too normal.

"Pa!" cried junior. "Them Zombies is in the pasture again!"

"Turn on the 'lectric fence," cried Farmer Owen, "an' git my laser rifle."

"I'll show dem zombies what for!"

They want to eat your brains, so stay one step ahead of them!

Use the joystick to move. You will automatically fire in the direction you are moving.
The zombies are coming up everywhere, and moving in towards you. They're slow, but deadly,
and only a head-shot will take them out. Some of these guys are JUST floating heads, take
those out too! They will attack in waves - sometimes more, sometimes less, be watchful!

Don't worry about a headless body - eventually it will disintegrate. It's harmless!

You score one point for every step you take and survive. You get two points every time a
zombie spawns, so keep blasting! (Score is displayed at the end).

Watch out for the electrified barriers - if you touch one, that's instant death!
