TI Farm for TI Extended BASIC
(copyright 2010 Howard Kistler/Dream Codex Retrogames)
======================================================

Place in the DSK1 folder of your Classic99 emulator,
launch with Extended BASIC enabled, and load with the
following commands:

OLD "DSK1.TIFARMER"
RUN

The game file is named TIFARMER to distinguish it
from the TI Farm project that's under discussion.
Not that you'd mistake this for that anyway.

GAMEPLAY
------------------------------------------------------

You are Farmer McOwen, red-blooded homesteader in
the America of 1900. You've set up a large farmhold
and are working to bring in enough money to live
a secure life. To do this you will need to work your
land, an expanse of acreage which you can work one
quad of each season. (The farm is very large, and
you also follow the wise path of rotating your crops.)

Each season you may do one of the following things:

PLOW

Break up the soil and plow under any remaining crop
material from previous seasons. You will be asked 
which quad you want to plow. Make sure you choose one
with plenty of unbroken ground (dark brown and cracked
looking earth).

SEED

Plant seeds in all the plowed ground of a quad. Plowed
ground is light brown and has a regular wavy texture.
Seeded ground will mature into harvestable crops at
the end of each Spring.

REAP

Harvest any mature crops in a quad. Mature crops are
dark green and leafy, while seedlings are light green
and grass-like. You will receive $1 for every crop
you harvest.

HIRE

Hire a farmhand to help around the place. This will
cost you $250 each time, and you can hire up to four
farmhands. They are displayed in red at the lower
right, with the first person representing yourself.
Each farmhand you hire reduces the impact of bad
events and increases the benefits of good events.
The farmhands available for hire are Katie Sue,
Slim Buck, Fat Roy, and L'il Rex.

QUIT

Exit the game. You will get a summary of how much you
earned by the time you quit. If you do not quit, the
game will continue to the year 2000, at which point
Farmer McOwen will have had enough and quit himself.

------------------------------------------------------
RANDOM EVENTS
------------------------------------------------------

Throughout the course of play random events will occur
on the farm. Some will benefit you (like a new tractor
that helps you break ground or windfall profits from
growing a high-demand crop), others will set you back
(insects may devour mature crops and a farmhand may
be eaten by one of the many zombies that roamed the
plains at this time). Hiring farmhands will help
offset the losses of bad events and will boost the
gains of good events, so keep a few handy.
